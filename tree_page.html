        <p>The trees seen in Royal Park are a wide variety of species ranging from native Eucalypts to European imports.
        their bark ranges from rough, fibre-like texture, to flat paper-like sheets, to smooth skin.</p>

        <p>Just as diverse are the leaves of native Eucalypts. While some of the more well-known ones feature thin, drooping leaves,
            others differ, featuring smaller thistles that poke out at anyone curious to reach in.

        <p>Near Brens Drive sits a peculiar tree standing out from the others. Its branches provide an overarching layer of shade and protection from the harsh elements,
            a perfect spot to hide away from the heat of the Australian Summer.

        <p>Two particular trees near the tram line stand out from the landscape. Devoid of most of their branches and leaves, these stumps are a monument of a tree
            that was once grander. Now, their bare stumps resemble twisting hands reaching for the heavens.
            <br>
            The age of a tree can be dated by the rings of its log. The more rings, the older the tree is. Given the size of these stumps, one must wonder what have these
            silent giants witnessed throughout the history of this land.
