        <p>Nearby, a railway line was built to connect the city.
            Its construction cleanly cut through the rocky hills revealing the sediment underneath.
            Hundreds of thousands of years of geological history revealed to us by our human needs and desires.

        <p>Historically, the site has been used by many people over time. With regards to European influence, the park was first reserved
            for the public in 1845 by Governer Charles LaTrobe. From there it had been used for different purposes, from an experimental farm,
            to the site of the ill-fated Burke and Wills' Expedition's departure.

            <br>
            In WW2, notably, it had been the location of a military camp housing American G.Is. Camp Pell, as it was known, was located
            roughly within the area that is now the Grass Circle. All that remains are the guard houses on Brens Drive, a lone monument to Melbourne's involvement
            in one of the largest wars in modern history.

        <p>It's often been said that upon arriving in Australia, the first European Settlers noted the lack of agrarian farmland by the Indigenous peoples,
            drawing to the conclusion that it lacked any form of civilisation. This misconception is born out of the Western concept of agriculture -
            large fields of monoculture crop or grazing cattle- and fails to understand the vast difference in practices between Western and Indigenous farmers.
            In reality, Indigenous farmers had cultivated thousands of years of experience in living sustainably off of the land, knowing when was the right time to
            hunt Kangaroo or to burn off old grass.

        </div>
        <br>
        <p>As the City grows and the demand for space and living along with it grows, we quickly find ourselves at a crisis of practices, where the western practice of agriculture
            and land ownership clash with traditional values of sustainability and coexistence with nature leading to unforseen consequences. Perhaps then, a new perspective of
            Australian living is needed in order to meet the demands of a 21st Century nation, one that looks to the time-held traditions of the past to define our future.
