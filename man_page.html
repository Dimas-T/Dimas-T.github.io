            and concrete footpaths, returning oneself to civilisation.

        <p>Nearby, a railway line was built to connect the city.
            Its construction cleanly cut through the rocky hills revealing the sediment underneath.
            Hundreds of thousands of years of geological history revealed to us by our human needs and desires.

        <p>Historically, the site has been used by many people over time. With regards to European influence, the park was first reserved
            for the public in 1845 by Governer Charles LaTrobe. From there it had been used for different purposes, from an experimental farm,
            to the site of the ill-fated Burke and Wills' Expedition's departure.

            In WW2, notably, it had been the location of a military camp housing American G.Is. Camp Pell, as it was known, was located
            roughly within the area that is now the Grass Circle.
